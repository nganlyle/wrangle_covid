- Convert all "suppressed" values to NA
- Convert NA values in the "Total Confirmed Cases" and "Total Deaths" columns to 0s
- Merge Special Unit Homes with their parent home

Adjust Covariates/Predictors
- ROOMS_*
  - Define binary variables for presence of semi or multi rooms
    - 248/297 (83%) homes have 0 multi-rooms
    - 128/297 (43%) homes have 0 semi-rooms
  - Define a binary variable for the presence of shared rooms

  - Resident council
  - Family council
  - Resident and Family councils


- Private beds
  - 205/297 of homes have 0 private beds
  - Define proportion, private beds/total beds
  - Define a binary variable for the presence of private beds

- Incident
  - Sum incident_100
  - Sum incident_100 except outbreaks
  - Keep incident_outbreak_100
  - Remove other subcategories of incident data


- Infractions
  - Define infractions/infractions_disease per 100 beds covariate
  - Define infractions - infractions_disease per 100 beds covariate
  - Remove subcategories of infractions data except disease


- Ownership
  - Define a binary variable for HA ownership vs not


- Removed irrelevant predictors


Selected Dataset
- As above
- Removed all predictors with missing values
- Binary logistic regression showed 2 significant predictors
  - FAMILY_COUNCIL
  - BEDS_TOTAL

**5homes Dataset**

Input: bc_ltc_complete.csv

Script: ngan_bc_filter_5homes.ipynb

- Merged "Special Unit" homes with the parent homes
  - Weighted average of DCH and demographic predictors
  - Sum of the number of beds/rooms
  - Keep complaints, incident, inspections data from the parent home


- Removed 4 homes with suppressed data
  - Data on complaints, incidents and demographics suppressed


- Removed 1 new home with limited data
  - Data on DCH, complaints, incidents, demographic etc. missing


- Removed the predictors with missing values from what is left

Analysis:
  - Binary logistic regression showed 2 significant predictors

**Mainland Dataset**

Input: bc_ltc_complete.csv

Script: ngan_bc_filter_homes.ipynb
