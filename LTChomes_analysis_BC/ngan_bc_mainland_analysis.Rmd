## Import and prepare the data
```{r results="hide"}
library(skimr)
# library(dplyr)

# Import the data
df <- read.csv("../data/BC/ngan_bc_ltc_mainland_sel.csv", na.strings="", header=TRUE)
str(df)

```


```{r, echo=FALSE}
# Change datatypes as needed

listofcol = list('FACILITY_NAME', 'HCC_CODE')
for (each in listofcol){
  df[, each] <- as.character(df[, each])
}

listofcol = list('RESIDENT_COUNCIL', 'FAMILY_COUNCIL', 'BEDS_PRIVATEbinary', 'rooms_shared', 'outbreak', 'hospital_act', 'community_act', 'ROOMS_SEMIbinary', 'ROOMS_MULTIbinary')
for (each in listofcol){
  df[, each] <- as.factor(df[, each])
}

str(df)
dput(names(df))

# 34/131 homes had an outbreak
table(df['outbreak'])
```

```{r, include=FALSE}
# Divide the variables into numeric and categorical types

num <- c(
  "BEDS_TOTAL", 
  "COMPLAINTS", 
  "SUB_COMPLAINTS", 
  "AGE", 
  "FEMALE", 
  "ISE_LOW", 
  "CMI", 
  "INSPECTIONS", 
  "INFRACTIONS", 
  "INCIDENTS_100sum",
  "DCH_NURSE",
  "DCH_ALLLIED",
  "DCH_TOTAL",
  "BEDS_PRIVATEprop")

cat <- c(
    "HLTH_AUTH", 
    "OWNERSHIP", 
    # "REGULATION", 
    "ACCRED_STATUS",
    "BEDS_PRIVATEbinary", 
    "rooms_shared",
    "ROOMS_SEMIbinary", 
    "ROOMS_MULTIbinary",
    "RESIDENT_COUNCIL", 
    "FAMILY_COUNCIL",
    "hospital_act",
    "community_act"
)

# Subset the data for analysis
data <- subset(df, select = c(num, cat, 'outbreak'))

dput(names(data))
# str(data)
```

```{r, }
## Assessing skewness
# Check for R skewness in numeric predictors
library(e1071)

for (each in num){
  print(each)
  print(skewness(data[[each]]))
  # qqnorm(data[[each]], main = each)
  # qqline(data[[each]], col = 'red')
}

```

We see above that most of the numeric predictors are right skewed to various degrees. 
  - Highly right skewed for skewness values > 1. 
  - Mildly right skewed for skewness values between 0 and 1

There are some left skewed predictors:
[1] "AGE"
[1] -4.35839
[1] "FEMALE"
[1] -1.039271
[1] "ISE_LOW"
[1] -0.3928765


We explore the variables to assess for zero values prior to transformation. 

```{r, }
# Assess numeric predictors for 0s
for (each in num){
  print(each)
  print(summary(df[[each]]))
}

```

Variables without 0s:
  "BEDS_TOTAL", 
  "AGE", 
  "FEMALE", 
  "ISE_LOW", 
  "CMI", 
  "DCH_NURSE",
  "DCH_ALLLIED",
  "DCH_TOTAL"

Variables with 0s:  
  "COMPLAINTS", 
  "SUB_COMPLAINTS", 
  "INSPECTIONS", 
  "INFRACTIONS", 
  "INCIDENTS_100sum",
  "BEDS_PRIVATEprop"

  
## Explore the variables for transformation
It is often a good idea to apply the sqrt transformation to count data:
  "BEDS_TOTAL", 
  "COMPLAINTS", 
  "SUB_COMPLAINTS", 
  "INSPECTIONS",
  "INCIDENTS_100sum"
  

```{r, }
summary(data['INCIDENTS_100sum'])
```

```{r, }
# List of numeric variables without 0s
list_non0s <- c(
  "BEDS_TOTAL", 
  "AGE", 
  "FEMALE", 
  "ISE_LOW", 
  "CMI", 
  "DCH_NURSE",
  "DCH_ALLLIED",
  "DCH_TOTAL"
)

# List of numeric variables with 0s
list_0s <- setdiff(num, list_non0s)

# List of numeric variables without 0s that are right skewed
list_non0s_right <- c(
  "BEDS_TOTAL", 
  "CMI", 
  "DCH_NURSE",
  "DCH_ALLLIED",
  "DCH_TOTAL"
)

# List of numeric variables without 0s that are left skewed
list_non0s_left <- c(
  "AGE", 
  "FEMALE", 
  "ISE_LOW"
)

```

```{r }

library(rcompanion)

# Visualize the effect of square root and log transformations on right skewed data without 0s
for (each in list_non0s_right) {  
  plotNormalHistogram(x = data[[each]], main = each)
  plotNormalHistogram(x = sqrt(data[[each]]), main = c(each, 'sqrt trans'))
  plotNormalHistogram(x = log(data[[each]]), main = c(each, 'log trans'))
}

# Can log transform all except BEDS_TOTAL

# Visualize the effect of square root and cube root transformation on right skewed data with 0s
for (each in list_0s) {  
  plotNormalHistogram(x = data[[each]], main = each)
  plotNormalHistogram(x = sqrt(data[[each]]), main = c(each, 'sqrt trans'))
  plotNormalHistogram(x = (data[[each]])^1/3, main = c(each, 'cube rt'))
}

# Generally the cube root transformation does not add much to a square root transformation



```


```{r, }

```

## Transform the data
```{r }
# # Square root transform in place
# data[c(list_0s)] <- sqrt(data[c(list_0s)])
# 
# skim(data)

```


## Fit logistic regression
```{r }
# Fit logistic regression using transformed data
fit = glm(outbreak~., family=binomial, data=data)
summary(fit)
```


```{r }
# Backward selection using AIC
fit_back_aic = step(fit, direction = "backward")
coef(fit_back_aic)
```


```{r }
# Bacward selection using BIC
n = length((resid(fit)))
fit_back_bic = step(fit, direction = "backward", k = log(n))

coef(fit_back_bic)
```

```{r }
# A function which calculates the LOOCV RMSE
calc_loocv_rmse = function(model) {
  sqrt(mean((resid(model) / (1 - hatvalues(model))) ^ 2))
}

# Calculate LOOCV RMSE for each model
calc_loocv_rmse(fit)
calc_loocv_rmse(fit_back_aic)
calc_loocv_rmse(fit_back_bic)
```

## Using the stepAIC() function
```{r }
library(MASS)

null <- glm(outbreak ~ 1, family = "binomial", data=data) # 1 here means the intercept 
full <- glm(outbreak ~ BEDS_TOTAL + COMPLAINTS + SUB_COMPLAINTS + AGE + FEMALE + ISE_LOW + CMI +
    INSPECTIONS + INFRACTIONS + INCIDENTS_100sum + DCH_NURSE + DCH_ALLLIED + DCH_TOTAL +
    HLTH_AUTH + OWNERSHIP + ACCRED_STATUS + FAMILY_COUNCIL + RESIDENT_COUNCIL + BEDS_PRIVATEbinary +
    rooms_shared + community_act + hospital_act + ROOMS_SEMIbinary + ROOMS_MULTIbinary, 
  family = "binomial", data=data)

stepAIC(full, scope=list(lower=null, upper=full), data=data, direction='backward')
# stepAIC(null, scope=list(lower=null, upper=full), data=data, direction='forward')
```

```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r }

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
