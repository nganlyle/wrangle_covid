## HR analysis BC

The analysis was performed at the HSD rather than HA level. This is because some data were only available at the HSDA level including the Health data and the Census data.

There are 16 HSDs in BC. These aggregate to 5 HAs.

### Proximity Data Preparation

1. Clean the Proximity Measures Database for manipulation in QGIS and in preparation for aggregation.

Type | Name
--|--
Script | proximity_data_prep_BC.ipynb
Input files | PMD-en.csv
Output file | proximity_data_prep_forQGIS_BC.csv

The Proximity Measures Database was downloaded from [Statistics Canada](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/pub/17-26-0002/2020001/csv/pmd-eng.zip).

2. Aggregate the proximity data from the dissemination block (DB) to the HSD/HA level.

--|--
Script | proximity_data_aggregation_BC.ipynb
Input files | <ul><li>Joined_DB_to_HR_BC.csv</li><li>proximity_data_prep_forQGIS_BC.csv</li></ul>
Output file | <ul><li>proximity_data_aggregated_BC_HSD.csv</li><li>proximity_data_aggregated_BC_HA.csv</li></ul>

The proximity data were aggregated from the DB to the HSD/HA levels using 2 methods:

1. The proximity value for each PHU was taken to be the sum of the population weighted proximity measures of the DBs.
2. The proximity value for each PHU was taken to be the median of the proximity values at the DB level.

The amenity score of the PHU was taken to be the mean of the amenity scores of the DBs.


### Health/Comorbidity Data Preparation

Script | comorbidity_data_prep_BC.ipynb
Input files | 13100113.csv
Output file | <ul><li>comorbidity_data_percent_BC.csv</li><li>comorbidity_data_num_BC.csv</li></ul>

The Health characteristics, two-year period estimates was downloaded from [Statistics Canada](https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=1310011301). Health data were grouped at the Health Service Delivery (HSD) level rather than the Health Authority (HA) level.

### COVID Data preparation

--|--
Script | covid_data_prep_BC.ipynb
Input files | <ul><li>BCCDC_COVID19_Dashboard_Case_Details.csv</
Output file | cases_by_HA.csv

http://www.bccdc.ca/health-info/diseases-conditions/covid-19/data

As of July 9, 2020, B.C. is reporting separately on COVID-19 cases in individuals whose primary residence is outside of Canada. Previously, these cases were assigned to the health authority that reported the case.
- Note that "Out of Canada" cases were dropped from the database.

As of June 4, 2020, B.C. is reporting epi-linked cases, meaning people who were never tested but were presumed to have COVID-19 because they developed symptoms and were close contacts of a laboratory confirmed case. Epi-linked cases identified since May 19, 2020, are now included in the case total, but are not considered new cases unless they were reported in the last 24 hours.

COVID cases data at the HSD level were manually extracted from the COVID-19 cases by Health Service Delivery Area map (.png filetype).

### Census Profile Data preparation

Type | Name
--|--
Script | census_data_prep_BC.ipynb
Input files | <ul><li>98-401-X2016058_English_CSV_data.csv</li><li>selected_variables.csv</li></ul>
Output file | census_data_BC.csv

The Census Profile at the HSD (not the HA) level was downloaded from [Statistics Canada](https://www12.statcan.gc.ca/census-recensement/2016/dp-pd/prof/details/download-telecharger/comp/page_dl-tc.cfm?Lang=E).

### Merge Data

HSDs were linked to HAs and Peer Group classifications manually in the file HSD_HA_names_id.csv.

Script | merge_data_BC_HSD.ipynb
Input files | <ul><li>HSD_HA_names_id.csv</li><li>proximity_data_aggregated_BC_HSD.csv</li><li>comorbidity_data_percent_BC.csv</li><li>census_data_BC.csv</li><li>cases_by_HSD_071620.csv</li></ul>
